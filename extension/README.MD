# üß† WhatsApp Web Custom Emoji Extension

This Chrome extension replaces the default emoji reaction bar (the 6 emojis + ‚ûï icon) on WhatsApp Web with **model-predicted emojis**. 

It does not support actually sending the emoji as this is highly limited by WhatsApp.

## üß™ How It Works

- The extension listens for the emoji reaction bar (the dock with 6 emojis).
- Once it appears, it replaces the default emojis with custom ones (e.g. üß†, üå∂Ô∏è, ü•µ).
- Clicking one sends a **mapped real reaction** (e.g. üß† ‚Üí üëç) that is synced to both chat participants.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è WhatsApp only supports a limited set of reaction emojis. Custom emojis are mapped to the nearest allowed ones.
